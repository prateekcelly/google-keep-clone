# Google Keep Clone with React and Firebase

Inspired by this [Scotch.io tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/building-a-google-keep-clone-with-vue-and-firebase-pt-1)

Built with:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [react-masonry-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-masonry-css)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)

## Getting Started

1. Create a .env file with the following content and fill in the environment variables from your firebase app.

   ```
   REACT_APP_API_KEY =
   REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN =
   REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL =
   REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID =
   REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET =
   REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID =
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

3. Fire up the local server
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
